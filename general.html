                    When a retiree finishes their career it’s important to celebrate everything they’ve achieved. That might be with a party at the office with 
coworkers or through a family get-together. Either way, we’ve provided creative and simple retirement party ideas below that will help you plan the 
perfect party, from the invitations to the decor.
                </p>
                <p >
                    Most traditional retirement parties involve speeches that honor the contributions of the retiree. Usually the person throwing the party
 gives a speech, but you can also ask bosses, employees, friends or family to say something. A retirement party theme should reflect on a person’s 
career and life. You can focus on how the retiree chose their career path or you can
 focus on their future plans. However, try to keep the theme specific.
